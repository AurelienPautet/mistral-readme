## Features

- **Smart Context Analysis**: Automatically fetches and parses `package.json` from any public GitHub repository to understand your tech stack.
- **AI-Powered Interview**: Instead of generic templates, the AI asks specific questions based on your dependencies (e.g., asking about Tailwind config if detected).
- **Real-time Preview**: View the generated Markdown rendered cleanly using Tailwind Typography.
- **Dogfooding**: This very README you are reading was generated by the tool itself.

## Tech Stack

This project was built with a focus on modern best practices and performance:

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **AI Integration**: Mistral AI SDK
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS
- **Styling**: @tailwindcss/typography
- **Markdown Rendering**: react-markdown
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A valid [Mistral AI API Key](https://console.mistral.ai/)
- **Docker** (Optional, if using Dev Containers)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AurelienPautet/mistral-readme.git
   cd mistral-readme
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   This project uses pnpm for efficient dependency management.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**

   Create a local environment file based on the example.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Open `.env.local` and add your API key:

   ```env
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser.

### Using Dev Containers

This project is configured with a VS Code Dev Container. This ensures a consistent development environment without needing to install Node.js or pnpm locally.

1. Ensure Docker Desktop and VS Code are installed.
2. Open the project in VS Code.
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use the Command Palette: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`).
4. The environment will set itself up automatically.

## Usage Guide

1. **Import Context**: Paste a GitHub repository URL (e.g., `facebook/react`). The app will fetch the `package.json` to understand the project.
2. **Select Sections**: Choose which parts of the README you want (Installation, Usage, Contributing, etc.).
3. **The Interview**: Answer the AI's targeted questions.
4. **Generate**: Copy the final Markdown code directly to your clipboard.

## Contributing

This project was developed as part of a technical assessment for an internship application. While it is fully functional, it is primarily a demonstration of technical skills using the Mistral SDK.
